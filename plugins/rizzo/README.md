rizzo.py
==========

Features
----------

Identifies and re-names functions between two or more IDBs based on:
  * Formal signatures (i.e., exact function signatures)
  * References to unique string
  * References to unique constants
  * Fuzzy signatures (i.e., similar function signatures)
  * Call graphs (e.g., identification by association)

Usage
-----

To generate signatures for functions in your current IDB:

![Generating Rizzo signatures](./images/rizzo_generate.png)

To apply generated signatures to your current IDB:

![Applying Rizzo signatures](./images/rizzo_apply.png)

Some pre-generated signatures are provided in the included sub-directories.

Installation
------------

Just copy `rizzo.py` into your IDA `plugins` directory.
